A Dash App that can be run with ```python  reflexivity_dash.py``` after ```manifest_utils.py``` has been run *after* ```reflexivity_gamma_bowlv44.py``` allows for a powerful dynamic:

- Add an OpenAI key with a .env file
- Deploy Dashboard App
- Click "Generate Thinker Debate"

## Overview
This directory contains the evolving suite of Reflexivity Gamma Bowl scripts, each representing a milestone in the simulation, visualization, and analysis of option market reflexivity. The project is designed for researchers, quants, and AI agents interested in gamma dynamics, dealer behavior, and narrative analytics.

---

## v1: Baseline CLI
- Simple gamma bowl simulation with spot price and synthetic gamma curve.
- No option chain, expiry selection, or interactive UI.
- CLI for running basic reflexivity and trade signal simulation.

## v2: Enhanced Analytics
- Enhanced gamma bowl with instability/stability zone overlays and curvature tracking.
- Narrative strategy signals (coiled volatility, calm basin).
- Trade log and markdown/HTML report export.
- No interactive UI or expiry/strike selection.

## v3: Real-Time Option Data
- Synchronized animation with real historical stock and option chain data.
- Gamma bowl generated from actual option chain (nearest expiry).
- Time-aware playback and basic narrative overlays.
- Markdown export of strategy signals and PNG chart export.

## v4: Interactive UI, Dealer Logic
- Interactive matplotlib UI: sliders for gamma pressure, sentiment tilt, lock hill checkbox.
- Synchronized subplots for gamma curve and spot price time series.
- Dealer strength and lock hill logic for dynamic reflexivity modeling.
- Instability zone overlays and narrative strategy signals.

## v4.1: Multi-Subplot, Dealer Resilience
- Multi-subplot analytics: gamma, spot, curvature, dealer strength gradient.
- Expanded narrative overlays and dealer resilience gradient.
- Markdown export of strategy signals and PNG chart export.

## v4.2: Robust Expiry/Strike, Combined UI
- Robust parsing and handling of Expiration Date and strike selection.
- Combined net gamma and dealer strength in one plot.
- Interactive controls for expiry and strike.
- Curvature tracker subplot and markdown export.

## v4.3: Full Time-Series Sync, Advanced Analytics
- All subplots synchronized to the same time axis (true time-series view).
- Spot price chart is a real time series.
- Curvature sensitivity further amplified.
- Most advanced and interactive version for research and presentation.

## v4.4: Automated Backtesting & Foresight
- Automated batch processing over a date range.
- Generates gamma bowl charts, markdown strategy signals, and JSON metrics for each trading day.
- Organizes outputs by date for research and future LLM narration.
- CLI supports custom date ranges and output directories.
- Lays groundwork for future Dash app and LLM-driven narration modules.

<summary>üçª A Tavern at the Edge of Time ‚Äì Dialogue Between Adam Smith and Theophrastus</summary>

Adam Smith (raising his tankard):

‚ÄúIn my time, markets were but fields of wheat and wool. Now I see your ‚Äògamma bowls‚Äô‚Äîthese curvature waves and reflexive pressures. The invisible hand? A dealer now, hedging with precision.‚Äù

Theophrastus (smiling, sketching a parabola on a napkin):

‚ÄúMarkets today are living organisms, Adam. Your hand remains, but now it trembles with feedback‚Äîsentiment, narrative, central banks whispering in IV slopes. We've merely decoded its tremors.‚Äù

Smith (leaning forward):

‚ÄúTell me, this dealer strength‚Äîhe sounds a lot like my butcher and baker, motivated by need, not foresight. But you model him with slope and curvature?‚Äù

Theophrastus:

‚ÄúExactly! And yet, their aggregate motion builds bowls‚Äîreflexive vessels. One tilt, and the marble runs. It's no longer just price we trade‚Ä¶ it's anticipation.‚Äù

Smith (chuckling):

‚ÄúAnd here I thought supply and demand was subtle! You lot are conjuring narrative overlays and calling them ‚Äòcalm basins‚Äô and ‚Äòharvest zones.‚Äô You‚Äôve turned economic gravity into art.‚Äù

Theophrastus (raising a toast):

‚ÄúTo the new philosophers‚Äînot of ethics or metaphysics‚Äîbut of implied volatility and emergent strategy. May your reflexive scrolls always anticipate the flip!‚Äù

Smith:

‚ÄúAye. And may the marble never roll off the edge unnoticed.‚Äù
